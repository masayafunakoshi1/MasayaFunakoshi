              Hey there! My name's Masaya Funakoshi, 22-years-old, born and
              raised in Tarrytown, NY. Currently specializing in Front-End Web
              Development, primarily focusing on HTML, CSS, JS and React.
              Completely self-taught for the past 9-months and going strong till
              I find my first dev role!
              <p>
                I graduated in the Spring of 2020 with a BA in Arts
                Management... right at the peak of the pandemic üòÖ. The Arts
                took quite a hit from the quarantine, so with my lack of
                jobs/internships and newly found time, I actually decided to do
                something productive and learned how to code! And of course, you
                know how the story goes... I fell in love with it üòç
              </p>
              <p>
                I always thought I was too dumb to learn how to code, and saying
                I wasn't good at Math or Science is putting it lightly. BUT
                despite all that, a friend inspired me try a website called{" "}
                <a
                  className="AboutMe-Link-Text"
                  href="https://www.internetingishard.com/"

                , teaching me the basics of HTML and CSS. It wasn't a "Hello
                World!" for me, no, it was when I was able to change the size
                and color of a blue HTML &#60;div&#62; to red with a seperate
                CSS doc. It blew my mind. I was hooked. I had to know more.
              </p>
              <p>
                Throughout this journey, it's been a series of ups and downs.
                The euphoria you feel when you solve an issue that's been
                bugging you for days, as well as the frustration of a small
                problem leading you down a rabbit hole, eventually creating even
                more problems than you thought possible. At the end of the day,
                it's taught me a mindset, any problem can be solved with enough
                perserverance, logical thinking, and Google. I appreciate the
                experiences I've had so far, and am looking forward to
                adventures that await!
